# LogicMonitor Platform Config

LogicMonitor doesn't have a built-in function to backup or roll back config changes, so the config will be maintained here.  Over time, the intention is to control the configuration of LogicMonitor through pipelines, but in the meantime it'll be manual copy/paste exercise.
